/* 

(TODO)
- implement service to retrieve the aggregated temperature data (hourly, daily):
- store results into hourly and daily temperature objects
- - add cron job to retrieve 
- refactore `TemperatureService#getAllTemperatures` to return `min, max, average` temperatures per hour, day
- Documenting an API using _swagger_
- cleanup readmy
- add unit tests
- add validation and constraints to domain classes
- handle exeptions/errors
